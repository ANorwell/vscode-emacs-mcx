# emacs-mcx [WIP]

This Visual Studio Code extension provides emacs-like keybindings and operations.
This is inspired by [the great vscode extension by hiro-sun](https://github.com/hiro-sun/vscode-emacs) and its forks such as [vscode-emacs-friendly by Sebastian Zaha](https://github.com/SebastianZaha/vscode-emacs-friendly), [vscode-emacs-improved by rkwan94](https://github.com/rkwan94/vscode-emacs) and [vscode-emacs-neon by NotKyon](https://github.com/NotKyon/vscode-emacs-neon).

Though there were such great extensions, this extension is written from scratch because it was hard to achieve the goal listed below by extending the existent code base.

This extension aims
* to provide emacs-like keybindings
* to be fully compatible with multi cursor
* to support kill-ring integrated with the system clipboard
* to fix some bugs in the existing extensions such as
    * mark-mode states are shared amoung all editors
